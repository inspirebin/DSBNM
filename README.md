**Umm..I got it but where can i use it ?**
-------------
Like for instance you are writing a story ,maybe like game of thrones in which you want to create some fictional name! or maybe if you have a plan for a startup,but stuck on  brand  name! 

All the generated names are pronounceable, this is made by interweaving vowels and  consonants together, However that might not always bring in great words,so we need to fine tune the algorithm to make better awesome sounding words.
